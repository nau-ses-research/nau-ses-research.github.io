His research focuses on understanding the complex relationships between groundwater, surface water, and ecosystem health, with particular emphasis on springs ecosystems.\nResearch Interests Springs Ecology and Ecohydrology Investigation of springs as unique ecosystems and biodiversity hotspots Understanding groundwater-surface water interactions in spring systems Development of classification systems for springs ecosystems Assessment of spring ecosystem health and function Climate Change Refugia Research on springs as “wet refuges” for plants and animals Understanding how groundwater-fed springs buffer against climate-induced drying Investigation of springs as potential climate change refugia Analysis of ecosystem resilience in arid and semi-arid environments Aquifer Health and Groundwater Resources Assessment of aquifer conditions and groundwater sustainability Investigation of human impacts on groundwater systems Understanding connections between aquifer health and spring ecosystems Groundwater resource management and conservation Education Ph.D. Hydrogeology/Earth Sciences M.S. Hydrology/Water Resources B.S. Earth Sciences Research Impact Dr. Springer has made significant contributions to understanding springs ecosystems, with over 1,900 citations of his research.

This cooling seems to be driven by slow cycles in the Earth’s orbit, which reduced the amount of summer sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere, culminating in the ‘Little Ice Age’ of recent centuries.”\nMajor Research Projects Global Holocene Climate Study Co-led international collaboration of 93 paleoclimate scientists from 23 countries Compiled 1,319 data records from 679 sites globally Published comprehensive paleoclimate dataset covering the past 12,000 years Demonstrated that recent warming has reversed 6,500 years of natural cooling Data Assimilation Research Principal investigator for “A global Data Assimilation of Moisture Patterns from 21,000-0 BP (DAMP-21ka)” Published in Climate of the Past (2024) Advanced methodological approaches to paleoclimate data integration Publications and Research Impact Dr. Erb has authored over 30 peer-reviewed journal articles, publishing in top-tier journals including:\nNature Geophysical Research Letters Climate of the Past Other leading atmospheric science and paleoclimate journals Funding and Grants Dr. Erb’s research is supported by significant federal funding:\nNational Science Foundation grants totaling over $1.2 million for paleoclimate research Recent NSF award of $678,000 for extended research through 2023 Multiple collaborative grants supporting international paleoclimate initiatives Teaching Experience Northern Arizona University Climate Dynamics (Spring 2020, Spring 2022) Guest Lecturer - Topics in Quaternary Science Fill-in Lecturer - Global Climate Change Rutgers University Teaching Assistant - Multiple meteorology and atmospheric science courses Fill-in Lecturer - Physical Principles of Climate Change Collaborative Research Dr. Erb works closely with renowned paleoclimatologists:\nDarrell Kaufman - Regents’ Professor (lead PI on major projects) Nicholas McKay - Associate Professor in climate informatics Cody Routson - Assistant Research Professor International network of paleoclimate researchers Professional Service Member of international paleoclimate research consortiums Contributor to major paleoclimate database initiatives Reviewer for leading atmospheric science and paleoclimate journals Advocate for open science and data sharing in paleoclimatology Research Impact Dr. Erb’s work contributes directly to understanding natural climate variability, providing crucial context for assessing current anthropogenic climate change.
