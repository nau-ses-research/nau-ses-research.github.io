## About

Dr. Thomas Sisk is a Professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University, where he has been a faculty member since 2000. His research integrates landscape ecology, conservation biology, and environmental policy to address complex environmental challenges, particularly in fire-prone landscapes of the western United States.

## Research Interests

### Landscape Ecology
- Spatial patterns of biodiversity across heterogeneous landscapes
- Effects of habitat fragmentation on species populations
- Ecosystem services in managed and natural landscapes

### Wildfire Research
- Post-fire forest recovery and restoration
- Wildlife habitat in fire-disturbed landscapes
- Integration of remote sensing and field ecology for fire research

### Conservation Biology
- Design and management of protected area networks
- Population dynamics of endangered species
- Human-wildlife conflict resolution

### Science-Policy Integration
- Translating scientific research into conservation policy
- Stakeholder engagement in environmental decision-making
- Adaptive management strategies for natural resources

## Education
