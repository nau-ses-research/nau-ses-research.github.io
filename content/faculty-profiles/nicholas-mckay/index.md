## About

Dr. Nicholas McKay is an Associate Professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University, where he has been a faculty member since 2013. His research combines paleoclimatology with data science to understand climate variability and change over the past 12,000 years.

## Research Interests

### Paleoclimate Data Science
- Development of statistical methods for paleoclimate data analysis
- Integration of diverse proxy records into coherent climate reconstructions
- Uncertainty quantification in paleoclimate reconstructions

### Climate Informatics
- Database design and management for paleoclimate records
- Data standardization and quality control protocols
- Web-based tools for paleoclimate data visualization and analysis

### Holocene Climate Variability
- Regional and global patterns of temperature and hydroclimate change
- Climate responses to natural and anthropogenic forcing
- Comparison of paleoclimate data with climate model simulations

## Education

- **Ph.D.** Earth Sciences, University of Southern California
- **M.S.** Geological Sciences, University of Southern California
- **B.S.** Geology, Carleton College
