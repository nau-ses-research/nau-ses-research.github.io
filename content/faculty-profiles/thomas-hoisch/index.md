## About

Dr. Thomas D. (Todd) Hoisch is a Professor of Geology and former Department Chair in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University, where he has been a faculty member since 2000. He brings extensive experience in metamorphic petrology and field geology to his research and teaching.

## Research Interests

### Metamorphic Petrology
- Investigation of metamorphic processes in mountain belts
- Analysis of mineral equilibria and pressure-temperature conditions
- Study of metamorphic mineral assemblages and their implications
- Research on equilibria within quartz + muscovite + biotite + plagioclase + garnet assemblages

### Tectonics and Petrochronology
- Integration of metamorphic petrology with tectonic processes
- Timing of metamorphic events using petrochronological methods
- Understanding the relationship between deformation and metamorphism
- Regional tectonic evolution studies

### U.S. Cordilleran Geology
- Extensive field studies in the American Cordillera
- Metamorphic core complex research
- Investigation of Barrovian metamorphism in detachment fault footwalls
- Studies in Death Valley National Park and surrounding regions

### Geobarometry and Geothermometry
- Calibration of geobarometers for mineral assemblage analysis
- Development of pressure-temperature estimation techniques
- Empirical calibration of six geobarometers for specific mineral assemblages
