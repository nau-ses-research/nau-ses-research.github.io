## About

Dr. Paul Umhoefer is a Professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University, where he has been a faculty member since 2000. His research focuses on understanding the processes and products of crustal extension, with particular emphasis on continental rifting, metamorphic core complexes, and basin evolution.

## Research Interests

### Extensional Tectonics
- Continental rifting processes and structural evolution
- Metamorphic core complex development and kinematics
- Low-angle normal fault systems and detachment structures
- Transtensional deformation and oblique rifting

### Structural Geology
- Field-based structural analysis and geometric techniques
- Fault system evolution and linkage patterns
- Deformation mechanisms in different crustal levels
- Integration of structural data with geochronology

### Basin Analysis
- Syn-rift sedimentation and depositional systems
- Basin architecture and fill patterns
- Provenance analysis and paleodrainage reconstruction
- Hydrocarbon exploration applications

### Regional Geology
- Geology and tectonics of western North America
- Gulf of California extensional province
- Basin and Range structural evolution
- International collaborative research projects
