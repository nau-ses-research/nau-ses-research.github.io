## About

Dr. Erika M. Nowak is an Assistant Research Professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability and the Department of Biological Sciences at Northern Arizona University, where she has been a faculty member since 2017. She also serves as Assistant Curator of Herpetology and has over 25 years of experience researching reptiles and amphibians.

## Research Interests

### Herpetofauna Conservation
- Ecology, behavior, and conservation of threatened and endangered reptiles
- Science-based management of herpetofauna populations
- Conservation strategies for declining gartersnake species
- Habitat requirements and restoration for reptile species

### Endangered Species Research
- Federally threatened narrow-headed gartersnakes (*Thamnophis rufipunctatus*)
- Northern Mexican gartersnakes (*Thamnophis eques megalops*)
- Population monitoring and recovery strategies
- Habitat use and distribution studies

### Venomous Reptile Ecology
- Effects of translocation on "nuisance" venomous reptiles
- Predatory roles and niche separation of rattlesnakes
- Trophic-level impacts in human-developed areas
- Human-wildlife conflict mitigation

### Wildlife Inventory and Monitoring
- Herpetofauna and small vertebrate surveys
- Regional biodiversity assessments
- Long-term population monitoring programs
- Distribution mapping and habitat analysis
