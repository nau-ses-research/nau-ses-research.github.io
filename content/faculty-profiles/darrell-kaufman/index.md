## About

Dr. Darrell Kaufman is a Professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University, where he has been a faculty member since 2000. His research focuses on understanding past climate changes through the analysis of lake sediment records, with particular expertise in amino acid geochronology and biomarker analysis.

## Research Interests

### Paleoclimatology
- Reconstruction of Holocene climate variability using lake sediment cores
- Understanding climate-ecosystem interactions over the past 50,000 years
- Development of high-resolution proxy records for temperature and precipitation

### Geochronology  
- Amino acid racemization dating of organic materials
- Radiocarbon dating of lake sediments and organic matter
- Integration of multiple dating techniques for robust chronologies

### Arctic and Alpine Research
- Climate history of the Arctic and high-elevation environments
- Impact of climate change on sensitive ecosystems
- Comparative studies across different latitude and elevation gradients

## Education

- **Ph.D.** Geological Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder
- **M.S.** Geological Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder  
- **B.A.** Geology, Carleton College
